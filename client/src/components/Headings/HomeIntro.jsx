            Over 50.000 cats get admitted to the Australian RSPCA annually. Sadly many of them cannot be rehomed and are euthenaised. The cats that are adopted often have a troubled past and are difficult to rehabilitate.

            This app is to help you and your new companion focus on the positives and track them! Look back on moments of joy like your first pat, your first play and see their physical health radiate as they settle into their forever home.
