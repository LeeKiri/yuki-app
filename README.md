# Yuki Cat Adoption App
Yuki is an app to support people that adopt a cat from a shelter or rescue a stray. They can get support from our members in the community chat rooms, track their cats journey and watch informational videos from experts in cat psychology. 


 ## Description 

  * Users sign-up by entering their details as well as their cats details and the adoption date. 
  * They can track special events or significant moments including vet appointments, bonding or health issues.
  * There are a number of chat rooms members can join to talk about topics related to their cats journey from health, diet, socializing or general chat. 
  * Members are authenticated and only given acces to restricted pages when their username and email is confirmed with passport and bcrypt.
